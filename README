# dwm 

This is a fork from dwm
> dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

# Requirements

In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.

# Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


# Running dwm

Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    picom -b
    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm

# Fork changes

This is my personal fork, so it is or will match my likes, using patches or 
other source changes.

By now, the patches are:

    - Fibonacci layout with Mod+s
    - Uselessgaps for gaps 
    - Hide vacant tags 
    - Stacker, to move clientes through the stack, instead of only pushing the focused client to the primary

And personal changes are:
    - Disable focus change on mouse move
